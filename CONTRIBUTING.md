# Contributing to Glint

## Rules

- PR everything. Commits made directly to master are prohibited, except under specific circumstances and then only to project owners.
- Use feature branches. **Create an issue for every single feature or bug** and **label** it. If you are a core contributor, create a branch named feature/[issue #] to resolve the issue. If you are not a core contributor, fork and branch.
- Try to label issues and PRs as accurately as possible, especially in the case of PRs, where `semver-major`, `semver-minor` and `semver-patch` labels are available. Labels on issues should be a subset of the labels on the corresponding pull request; the milestones should match.
- Use github "Fixes #[issue]" syntax on your PRs to indicate which issues you are attempting to resolve
- Keep Glint small. If some piece of functionality can fit in a separate `glint-*` module, then it probably should
- Code coverage should strictly be enforced at 100%
- Please follow the JavaScript coding style exemplified by existing source files and enforced by Glint's `.eslintrc` configuration.

## Developing and Testing

### Linting and Testing
To test (with code coverage):

```bash
$ npm test
```

Due to a [bug in istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/issues/274), failing tests will report incorrect line numbers. For this situation, use `test:no-coverage`, which will omit code coverage reporting and give you accurate line numbers.

```bash
$ npm run test:no-coverage
```

### Debugging

To debug via `node debug`:

```bash
$ npm run debug
```

To debug via a remote debugger (of your choice):
```bash
$ npm run debug-remote
```

### Documentation (`mr-doc`)

To build the docs:

```bash
$ npm run docs
```
